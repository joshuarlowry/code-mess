# The Scattered Logic

In the beginning, there were **objects** pure and **true**,
Each carrying its own **logic**, its own **view**.
But somewhere along the way, we **lost** our **path**,
And **scattered** our **wisdom** in **functions**' wrath.

The **business rules** now **float** in **empty space**,
**Divorced** from **data**, without a **proper place**.
A user's name **validation** **lives apart**,
From the **User class** that should **hold** its **heart**.

**Functions** **multiply** like **weeds** in spring,
Each one a **fragment** of some **greater thing**.
**calculateTax()** sits in **utils.js**,
While **Order** knows **nothing** of its own **bliss**.

We've built a world of **orphaned** **algorithms**,
Where **context dies** in **procedural schisms**.
The code that should **live together**, **torn apart**,
Like lovers **separated** by **functional art**.

Oh, when will we learn to **bind** what **belongs**?
To **heal** these **architectural wrongs**?
