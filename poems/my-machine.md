# It Works on My Machine

You pushed a **new feature**, a code that's **brand new**,
Your message is simple: "It's all **working**, it's **true**!"
I **pull down** the changes and **fire up** the app,
And find a **new bug**, a **ridiculous trap**.

I **check** all the **versions**, the **configs**, the **trace**,
But the issue won't show its **frustrating face**.
I **send** you the **details**, the **logs**, and the **scream**,
You just look at me and you **shatter** my **dream**.
Then you give me that **grin** and finally **state**,
"Well, it **works on my machine**," and you **seal my fate**.

I **stare** at the screen, with a **blank, empty face**,
A `console.log` is my **only saving grace**.
I try to **debug** with a **line**, then a **hundred**,
My **time**, my **good spirits**, all completely **plundered**.

The **team** gathers 'round, a **sad, weary crew**,
"Oh, **not this again**," they all **sigh** and feel **blue**.
The **senior dev** shakes his head with a **groan**,
And mumbles, "That **local dev server** you own..."

The ticket gets **handed** to someone with **dread**,
A **new environment** is **built** in its stead.
And while it is **fixed**, a **new rule** is now **seen**,
"You **must use Docker** to run the whole scene."
