# The Giant Functions

The **code** is a **mess**, a real **tangled snare**,
With **functions** a **hundred lines long**, if we dare
To **read** all their **logic**, all wrapped in a bow,
A **giant black box**, and we're not in the know.

You **scroll down** and **scroll down** and then **scroll some more**,
And now you're **not sure** what it's even for.
The **bugs** start to **creep**, a slow, **painful sting**,
The **changes** we make, they **break everything**.

The **function's so big**, it's a **giant ordeal**,
To **test it** and prove that the **code is all real**.
We try to **mock things**, but the **chaos is grand**,
A **dozen dependencies** held in your hand.

So **break it apart**, make it **focused** and **lean**,
And finally **test it** and make it all **clean**.
If you **can't read it all** without a **deep sigh**,
It's **too long**, my friend, and we need to **say goodbye**.

Let's **name our functions** and keep them so **true**,
So others can **read them** and not want to **sue**.
