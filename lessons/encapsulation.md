Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, while hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.

This principle protects the internal state of objects and ensures that they can only be modified through well-defined interfaces. By controlling access to an object's internal data, we prevent external code from putting the object into an invalid state.

Good encapsulation means that clients of a class don't need to know how it works internally - they only need to know what it can do. This makes code more maintainable because internal implementations can change without affecting external code.

Think of a car: you don't need to understand the engine's internal workings to drive it. You interact through a simple interface: steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift.
