The Agile Manifesto values individuals and interactions over processes and tools. This principle recognizes that software development is fundamentally a human activity that requires collaboration, communication, and creativity.

While processes and tools are important, they should serve the people, not the other way around. Teams that focus too heavily on rigid processes often lose sight of the actual goal: delivering valuable software to users.

Agile teams prioritize face-to-face communication, encourage collaboration between developers and business stakeholders, and adapt their processes based on what works best for their specific context and team dynamics.

This approach leads to more responsive teams that can quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver software that truly meets user needs.
