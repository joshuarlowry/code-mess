Think of your objects as reusable building blocks. By creating small, focused, and well-encapsulated objects, you can combine them to build more complex systems. This is the opposite of a monolithic design where everything is tightly coupled.

Each object should be like a LEGO brickâ€”useful on its own, but even more powerful when combined with other objects. This composability allows you to build complex functionality by assembling simpler, well-tested components.

The key is to design objects with clear, minimal interfaces that make them easy to combine. When objects are loosely coupled and highly cohesive, you can rearrange and recombine them to meet changing requirements without rewriting large portions of your codebase.
