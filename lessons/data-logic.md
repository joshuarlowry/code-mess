This concept is a core tenet of Object-oriented programming (OOP). Instead of having separate data structures and functions that operate on them, you bundle them together into a single unitâ€”an object. This creates a clear and logical relationship between the data and the code that uses it.

When data and the logic that operates on it are separated, you end up with procedural code where functions take data as parameters and return modified data. This approach makes it harder to ensure data integrity and can lead to inconsistent behavior across different parts of the system.

By bundling data with its related behavior, objects become self-contained units that can maintain their own consistency and provide a clear interface for interaction. This encapsulation is fundamental to creating robust, maintainable software systems.
