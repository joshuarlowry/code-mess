Context switching between multiple tasks slows you down and increases the chance of bugs. By focusing on one thing at a time, you get to a 'done' state faster and deliver value sooner. The goal is to finish work, not just start it.

When you constantly start new tasks without finishing existing ones, you create a backlog of incomplete work that becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Each context switch requires mental overhead to remember where you left off, what decisions you made, and what still needs to be done.

The most productive developers are those who can resist the temptation to jump to the next exciting task and instead see their current work through to completion. This discipline leads to higher quality code, fewer bugs, and more predictable delivery timelines.
