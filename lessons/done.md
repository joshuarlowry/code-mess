Perfection is the enemy of progress. Instead of over-engineering or getting stuck on minor details, focus on creating a working, valuable solution first. You can always improve it later based on real-world feedback.

The concept of "done" is crucial in agile development. It means the feature works, meets the acceptance criteria, and delivers value to users. It doesn't mean it's perfect or handles every edge case imaginable.

Many developers struggle with this because they want to create elegant, comprehensive solutions. While this instinct is admirable, it often leads to over-engineering and delayed delivery. The market and users will teach you what really matters much faster than theoretical planning ever could.
