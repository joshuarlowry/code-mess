When a new idea comes up, it's tempting to jump on it immediately. However, abandoning ongoing work to chase the new shiny thing creates incomplete features and technical debt. Stay disciplined and see existing work through to completion before starting the next.

New ideas are exciting because they represent possibility and potential. They haven't yet been tainted by the reality of implementation challenges, edge cases, and compromises. This makes them inherently more appealing than the current work you're grinding through.

The discipline to resist new ideas until current work is complete is what separates successful developers from those who leave a trail of half-finished projects. Keep a backlog of new ideas, but don't let them derail your current focus.
