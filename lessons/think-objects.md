Object-oriented programming (OOP) isn't just about using classes. It's a way of thinking about your code in terms of real-world or conceptual 'objects' that have state (data) and behavior (methods). This maps well to complex problem domains.

When you think in objects, you're modeling your software after things that make sense in the problem domain. A banking application might have Account, Transaction, and Customer objects. Each object represents something meaningful in the business context.

This approach makes code more intuitive and easier to discuss with non-technical stakeholders. When you can say "the Customer object calculates its credit score" instead of "the calculateCreditScore function takes customer data," you're speaking in terms that business people understand.
