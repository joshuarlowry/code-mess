Work In Progress (WIP) is your worst enemy. It means you have multiple unfinished tasks. The more WIP you have, the more you get distracted and the less productive you are. Limiting your WIP is key to a healthy development cycle.

High WIP creates a vicious cycle: the more unfinished work you have, the more pressure you feel to start new tasks to show progress. But this only compounds the problem, creating even more incomplete work and increasing stress levels.

Teams that successfully limit WIP often use techniques like Kanban boards with explicit WIP limits, or time-boxing methods like Pomodoro technique. The key is to make WIP visible and actively manage it as a constraint, not just let it grow unchecked.
